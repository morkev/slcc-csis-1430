    <p><font face="verdana" color="black">Perseverance is a truly remarkable vehicle, and just as <i><b>Metallica</b></i>, it rocks... somehow... It will be carrying numerous experiments to Mars that will not only advance the goal of sending humans to the Red Planet, but will also search for evidence that Mars may once have sustained life. Additionally, Perseverance will carry a small helicopter called Ingenuity, marking the first time that an aircraft has ever flown on any planetary body other than Earth. Not only will Ingenuity provide remarkable images of the Martian surface, but, if successful, this technology could be a valuable tool for human explorers as they utilize drones to investigate hard-to-reach locations (cliff sides, caves, etc.) and provide the ability to do advanced reconnaissance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="verdana" color="black">Despite the challenges that face us here on Earth, we are entering what will almost certainly be one of the most exciting and relevant periods in the history of space exploration. Let us regard Perseverance as a symbol of the great things we can achieve today, and in the future, when people of all backgrounds, ethnicities and nationalities work together to explore the unknown.</font></p>
    <p><font face="verdana" color="black">I love science and computers; hopefully you can appretiate this work. Any source out there can be better than this one, so get out there and learn stuff!</font></p>
    <p><font face="verdana" color="black">You can click the name of the instruments to learn about them! Or... you can click the object itself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="verdana" color="black">Here are the obejcts you can interact with:</font></p>

    <ul>
      <li><font face="verdana" color="black">ROBOTIC ARM – looks like a stick, and allows rotational motion or translational displacement!</font></li>
      <li><font face="verdana" color="black">BODY – nucleus of the rover, main structure.</font></li>
      <li><font face="verdana" color="black">SHERLOC – above the robotic arm.</font></li>
      <li><font face="verdana" color="black">PIXL – bottom of the robotic arm.</font></li>
      <li><font face="verdana" color="black">FRONT HAZCAM – attached to the front of the body, prevents potential collisions.</font></li>
      <li><font face="verdana" color="black">REAR HAZCAMS – attached to the back of the body.</font></li>
      <li><font face="verdana" color="black">NAVCAM – located on the head, determines the navegation path.</font></li>
      <li><font face="verdana" color="black">MASTCAM – located on the head, takes image/video footage.</font></li>
      <li><font face="verdana" color="black">WHEELS – do you really need a description?</font></li>
    </ul>
