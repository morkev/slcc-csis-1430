    <h2 class="pageSubTitle">Dear readers,</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>These articles are focused on multiple perspectives about science,
      politics, and health within the residents of Utah. Some of them experienced economical growth,
      and many others lost their jobs due to the pandemic – we analyzed their behaviors,
      and how their ideas may or may have not changed as a direct consequence of being naïve with the regulations.
      Indeed, after all of these events, little reliable and representative information exists about how Utah
      residents are perceiving and behaving during the coronavirus pandemic, including how politics and views
      of science are driving behavior and attitudes regarding COVID-19.</p>

    <p>Perhaps, this magazine exists with the only intention
      of providing accurate and updated data to the readers.</p>

    <p>The data in was based on an online panel survey of 6934 adult residents of Utah
      conducted from June 12th to March 24th, 2020. We use weights with the data
      (by sex, age, education, party registration, and region), to adjust the results
      somewhat to be more representative of adults in Utah. With weights, about half was
      identified as female, 40% has a college degree, and 35% are registered Republicans.</p>

    <p>Multiple graphs are depicted in order to make the interpretation easier,
      yet such are displayed in a format that anyone with very little knowledge
      of math would understand.</p>

    <p>During the stay-at-home advisory that lasted from mid-March to mid-May,
      most Utahns said they changed their behavior as a result of the pandemic...
      About two-thirds said they made major changes, one in four said they made minor changes,
      and one in ten made no changes in their daily routines. Once the stay-at-home advisory ended,
      about 40% were each still experiencing both major and minor changes to their daily lives.
      During the stay-at-home advisory, liberal, younger (18-34), and older (65+) Utahns were the most
      likely to have made major changes to their daily lives. Those living in rural places were the most
      likely to have made no changes. With the lifting of the advisory, liberals, Democrats,
      and older residents were more likely to be living with major changes.
      Upper, upper middle, and working classes were more likely than other classes to still be
      living with major changes to their lives while those in rural places were the most likely
      residence group to still have no changes to their daily livesAs the writer of this magazine,
      I would like to clarify that I do not have any preference for any political party nor social bias.
    </p>

    <p><i>Post factum</i>, there’s a very distinguishable difference in political and scientific views
      within Utahns – some people assume they shouldn’t be concerned about science-wise topics nor by
      wearing a mask (according to our data, these individuals follow the Republican Party, are upper class,
      very religious, or uneducated). Meanwhile, people concerned about wearing a mask or the very viewable
      effect of, perhaps, climate change tend to be Liberal, Democrat or highly educated. As we stated,
      we will let readers set their own premises/conclusions.</p>

    <h1 class="pageTitle">KAFKAESQUE</h1>
    <h2 class="pageSubTitle">A MEMOIR</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>It was April, and the year was 2020: a pandemic was challenging ourselves to something a bit new
      – we were all naïve, and the country was facing the sophisms and demagoguery of politicians.
      Maybe, dear reader, one of the local issues we face everyday is nothing,
      but the prudence of our politicians...</p>

    <p>It was just another dry, and sweaty day; I decided to not watch the news, nor turn on the radio while driving.
      Instead, I thought it would be a great opportunity to read one of those classic,
      and magnificent authors; in this particular case, Franz Kafka.</p>

    <p>I remember most of the book with king-size details! There, Kafka described a character (the Emperor) who was,
      somehow, a perfect reflection of colossal ignorance and poor communication – what a nightmare!
      Such oeuvre is known as “An Imperial Message (1930).”</p>

    <p>He wrote, “The Emperor — so they say — has sent a message, directly from his death bed, to you alone,
      his pathetic subject, a tiny shadow which has taken refuge at the furthest distance from the imperial sun.”</p>

    <p>I was shocked by his words, and the lack of hypocrisy, and how obnoxious would those
      letters may be for some persons nowadays. That Emperor, who is already dead, has,
      somehow, more value that you — who's still dealing with some sort of thing named life.
      — You and I, tiny shadows who try to hide from others’ attention; from the light, and
      from that imperial sun... We get it! It’s an interesting book, but how can this relate
      to our issue? Well, it relates in many ways (remember, Kafka’s books are connotative/fictional,
      but they face denotative/real life problems).</p>

    <p>We all know about Trump’s existence (at least for now). To addicts, their
      addiction dominates their thoughts, motivations and behaviors. And, in Trump
      it means filtering complex information into a funnel that leads to his basic
      addictive need for attention and approval; it means dumbing down complicated
      decisions to judging whether the information is for or against him.
      Whether a person is friend or not. Whether the material before him denies or supports
      his self-perception of being a superior person.</p>

    <p>Of course, the way words make you feel, or the way such make you remember mistakes,
      and maybe achievements is one of the most meaningful things in life, and of course, literature.
      Rather than numbers, it may be a matter of feelings or reproaches;
      unfortunately, it is almost always this last one.</p>

    <p>Nietzsche wrote, ”What are you doing here, lazy being, among the towers?
      Your place is inside the tower; there you should stay locked up, so you
      don't obstruct the way to one better than you.”</p>

    <p>And, again, those words make you feel useless. They make you think more about your decisions;
      your current position in life, and the organization of your thoughts –
      I think writing makes sense when you tell something, and also add interesting information,
      subjectively speaking. Here, we are comparing a local issue with quotes, and analyzing the
      structure and pivot of those books with the current world. Their oeuvres are always in a dark,
      and sad environment full of impossibility and misery – our lives can’t be as
      unfortunate as theirs; as the ones they are describing.</p>

    <p>In fact, the protagonist of “An Imperial Message” (the Herald) was always trying his best
      – fighting against all the obstacles to get that message delivered: “[...] moving forward easily,
      unlike anyone else.” That little statement, again, put my thoughts with Nietzsche's quote (Thus Spoke Zarathustra),
      “I want to continue towards my goal, I continue with my march; I will pass over the undecided and the decadent.
      My departure will be sunset for them!”</p>

    <p>There's no happy end in this story; in fact, there's no beginning. “If there were an open field,
      how he would fly along, and soon you would hear the marvelous pounding of his fist on your door.
      But instead of that, how futile are all his efforts. He is still forcing his way through the private
      rooms of the innermost palace. Never will he win his way through. And if he did manage that,
      nothing would have been achieved.”</p>

    <p>Franz's literature is extremely important for me, and I have no doubt that it changed
      my perspective towards my goals, and the expectations I should have with myself.
      More importantly, he remind me the humongous void between my dreams, and my possibilities.
      At the same time, these authors showed me how to compare our faded, and certainly dry reality
      with those scenarios described by themselves. I can thus, as an example,
      say how Trump has been refusing to do the entire campaign — pivot, and start running a lower-key,
      more disciplined, less egomaniacal campaign that’s less about his grudges and attention- seeking behavior.
      Memoirs are generally about me; my thoughts and experiences. The fact that we need to attach a
      local issue makes the dynamic a bit more interesting – specially, challenging. Now, while being here;
      writing between these four walls, I can say this text is about to end, with no intentions of continuing...</p>

    <p>Every one of the characters represented tend to describe one of our uncountable list of fears.
      I just firmly know that Kafka had an important place in my life, next to Nietzsche. Because after all,
      "You sit at your window and dream of that message when evening comes."</p>

    <h1 class="pageTitle">COVID-19 perspective</h1>
    <h2 class="pageSubTitle">Prevention, analysis, and data</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>By now, you probably know several people in your personal circle who have fallen ill.
      Many of them have probably recovered or are recovering without serious complications.
      But, by now, you probably also know an individual who has died or is struggling with long-term,
      sometimes devastating effects. Before our local (in this case, global) issue’s pivot,
      we need to understanding a few important concepts. For this, Dr. Sam Bender’s analysis will be crucial.</p>

    <p>In Bender’s words, “[About the pandemic]... I don’t wanna say it’s radically different
      because I think essentially we’re doing the same thing, but it looks radically different...
      And that’s been changing from, you know, February, March, and April, to now...
      In some ways, it’s evolved and in some ways, we’ve just sort of gotten better.
      But it is from an outsider’s perspective when it looks very different from how it was pre-COVID.”</p>

    <p>Of course, it’s easy to understand that each person may pass on a germ or virus to others
      with whom they come in contact, but the disease will not be transmitted if the recipient has
      a resistance to the disease, has had a vaccination, or has already been infected.
      Consequently, there is a “population of opportunity” to whom the disease can spread.
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a pandemic can start when three conditions
      have been met (i.e., a new virus subtype emerges, it infects humans and causes serious illness,
      and it spreads easily and sustainably among humans).</p>

    <p>Bender also added that when people assists for medical care, and when they are
      taking care of patients, they sort of think it’s the medicine; but you think it’s the science,
      you think it’s the intellect, the decision-making; the tests they run. But so much of
      it is also understanding a person, who they are, what they want, the things they like and dislike,
      what are their needs, what are their personalities. Everyone has their own psychological uniqueness
      – each of us. But that’s such a huge part of taking care of people that it just gets lost with
      a lot of these restrictions... And again, they’re obviously there for a reason.</p>

    <p>As Bender said, “You have to make sure that the patients don’t get sick from the doctors
      with the staff and the staff doesn't get sick from the patients. We all have to be wearing
      various different levels of gear to protect ourselves, whether it’s N95 masks, face shields,
      or less, it’s still some physical barrier between me and my patient in our relationship.</p>

    <p>We must not forget that we shall keep ourselves out of certain areas of risk. If this is something
      that you want to do, like get pregnant, and so you start focusing on behavior. You have to put yourself
      in as low-risk environment as you can. Bender added, “I think that we can be optimistic that at least
      we’re not going to wake up and find out that we’re at a peak without having any idea that things
      had gotten so out of hand. There are a lot of tools that are out there; helping the medical world
      track the virus a little bit. We’re trying to use them to try to keep things as safe as possible
      and to remind people where we are.”</p>

    <p>Viruses go beyond our reproach, and they don’t care about our political affiliation, nor who we voted for.
      They don’t ask if we believe in masking, nor even if we believe in viruses themselves.
      They won’t ask if we attended a political rally or social protests. And of course, they won’t ask where
      you got your education on virology or statistics...</p>

    <p>As health care providers continue to use their medical judgement to recommend the best course of treatment
      for an individual patient, we shall continue to use the available science and data to ensure those on the
      frontlines to have the tools and information necessary to combat this pandemic.3 If you put your child in
      a gun safety class before their first hunting season, you can respect wearing a mask; you can limit social
      gatherings; we can support our medical community by doing the very basic things they ask us to do.</p>

    <h1 class="pageTitle">Utah’s Media Reliance</h1>
    <h2 class="pageSubTitle">Misinformation and outcomes</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>Almost 4.66 billion people were active internet users as of October 2020,
      encompassing 59 percent of the global population. Mobile has now become the most
      important channel for internet access worldwide as mobile internet users account
      for 91 percent of total internet users. 1 It is also known that Utah had the
      second-highest online penetration rate as 88.1 percent of the state's population
      used the internet. Colorado was ranked first with 88.2 percent of online access
      anywhere in the United States.</p>

    <p>For instance, we shall ask ourselves how dangerous could be to claim something incorrect or
      misleading in the middle of a pandemic on the internet – things such as “The government is
      hiding microchips in Temple Square,” or “Be careful: the COVID-19 vaccines have a GPS to track us,”
      and of course: “5G produces cancer.” There are not enough words to describe the foolishness
      within those false premises, and we should probably not be looking for them.
      According to the 18 U.S.C. § 1038, "Whoever engages in any conduct with intent to convey
      false or misleading information under circumstances where such information may reasonably
      be believed and where such information indicates that an activity has taken, is taking,
      or will take place, then that would constitute a violation.” 3 These persons must be,
      therefore, fined under this title, or imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both.
      And of course, it can be much worse... But, why is nobody getting in trouble?
      How can the fact that we could potentially be harming someone due to his lack of knowledge
      be excused? In a nutshell, most fake-news sites often label their content as “satirical,”
      and unfortunately viral satires become often.
    </p>

    <p>Some persons agreed that misleading claims on social media will discourage COVID-19
      vaccination uptake, and others said that they would like to see greater transparency
      from social media platforms about the extent of misinformation so that public health
      authorities could effectively track and trace anti-vax sentiment. Certainly, social
      media has supercharged conspiracy theories and misinformation – there is a growing
      level of vaccine hesitancy and every study has shown up huge levels of misinformation
      around the world.</p>

    <p>In relation the previous idea, Liberals, Democrats, and Hispanics are less likely
      to trust information from Trump, while LDS residents of Utah are more likely to
      trust information from him. Trust in information from the state is higher among males,
      conservatives, Republicans, highly educated, older, upper class, and LDS Utah residents.
      The local government is trusted more often by conservative, upper class, suburban,
      and LDS residents. Scientists/researchers, the CDC, and WHO are more trusted as
      information sources among male, Liberal, Democrat, highly educated, upper/upper
      middle class and non-rural residents.</p>

    <p>Misinformation is being amplified on social media because tech giants design algorithms
      to offer content that keeps people engaged, as opposed to content that is factually correct.</p>

    <p>When comparing various levels of government on only their COVID-19 response,
      approval for handling is lowest for Congress at only 21%. Approval is much more
      bifurcated for President Trump (38% disapprove, 46% approve), but higher for
      Governor Herbert (52% approve) and local elected officials (48%). With the exception of Congress,
      liberal and Democrat Utahns are less likely to approve of the job various levels
      of government are doing to deal with COVID-19.</p>

    <p>Sounds impossible, but we must redesign our information ecosystem. Such effort should be global in scope
      – more broadly, we must answer a fundamental question: How could we possibly create a news ecosystem and
      culture that values and promotes truth in not only Utah, but the United States?</p>

    <h1 class="pageTitle">COVID-19: BEHAVIOR AND IDEOLOGY IN UTAH</h1>
    <h2 class="pageSubTitle">PERSUASION EFFECT</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>Daily life in the United States and Utah has changed considerably since the global
      outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus. As of March 31, 2021, the state with the
      highest number of COVID-19 cases was California. Utah (ranked 28) reached
      a total of 385,127 cases...</p>

    <p>However, after all of these events, little reliable and representative information
      exists about how Utah residents are perceiving and behaving during the coronavirus epidemic,
      including how politics and views of science are driving behavior and attitudes
      regarding COVID-19. Indeed, during the stay-at-home advisory that lasted from
      mid-March to mid-May, most Utahns said they changed their behavior as a result of the pandemic
      – let that be our purpose: show the “metamorphosis” within the Utahns mentality in
      not only politics, but also scientific topics and other social concerns.</p>

    <p>About one in three Utahns experienced a loss of employment income in their household,
      or has someone in their household who knows someone who has been sick from COVID-19.
      About one in ten has someone in their household who knows someone who has died because
      of COVID-19. Utahns who have lower levels of education, are younger, are either working
      or upper class, and are Hispanic were more likely to have experienced and/or fear future
      household employment loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hispanics were also more likely
      to know someone who had become sick and died of COVID-19 in Utah.</p>

    <p>When asked about their overall well-being since the pandemic started, most respondents (53%)
      said it had stayed the same, while about one in four said it had gotten worse. Liberals,
      democrats, younger residents (18-34), and lower and working class respondents were much
      more likely to say things had gotten worse.</p>

    <p>We previously talked about misinformation on social media, and about the future of the COVID-19
       pandemic in the U.S., most Utahns believe that the worst is yet to come (51%).
       Liberal, Democrat, and Hispanic residents were much more likely to think that the worse
       is yet to come, while members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS),
       on the other hand, were more likely to say that the worst is behind us –
       accumulating a total of 6%.</p>

    <p>But this is much more complex – we will try to simplify, because the repercussions
       of an incoherent response are more than operational: they further erode the
       response’s legitimacy, already undermined by credibility issues from the top.
       Presidential statements that the virus would only mildly impact the U.S. were
       exposed as invalid. Halting endorsements of virus mitigation and contradictions
       with public health experts, such as Dr. Fauci, undercut the seriousness and sincerity
       of national guidelines. The disabling effects of partisanship are evident in varied
       mitigation measures, public battles between the President and beleaguered governors,
       and the tenuous balance that state and local responses attempt to strike while
       conserving depleting resources.</p>

    <p>To be sure, sections of the American public, certain business interests, and the President’s
       political allies would disagree with many of these characterizations...</p>

    <p>When comparing various levels of government on only their COVID-19 response, approval
      for handling is lowest for Congress at only 21%. Approval is much more bifurcated
      for President Trump (38% disapprove, 46% approve), but higher for Governor Herbert
      (52% approve) and local elected officials (48%). With the exception of Congress,
      liberal and Democrat Utahns are less likely to approve of the job various levels
      of government are doing to deal with COVID-19.</p>

    <p>In relation to this political, it is true that local policies have little impact
      on the economy nor on local public health. Stay-at-home is only weakly associated
      with slower growth of COVID-19 cases. Stay-at-home is associated with lower workplace
      and more residential activity...</p>

    <p>Utahns get their news from a variety of sources. Local news is the most commonly used
      everyday news source with 26% of Utahns watching every day. A high percentage (21%)
      also get their daily news from social media.</p>

    <p>How could this – we shall ask – affect Utahns’ view about a variety of scientific topics?
      Well, the largest category of Utahns believe that Utah winter temperatures in recent decades
      are about the same, on average, as winters 30 or 40 years ago. About one in five believe they
      have gotten warmer, one in ten cooler, and about two in ten are not sure. Liberal and Democrat
      respondents were more likely to think they have gotten warmer.</p>

    <p>Certainly, Utah residents have some concern about climate change with 29% being very
      concerned and 35% being somewhat concerned. About one in four are not very concerned and
      one in ten are not concerned at all. Liberal, Democrat, younger, Hispanic, and not LDS
      have greater levels of concern. On the other hand, those in the Western region are less
      likely to be very concerned about Climate Change than those living in other regions –
      see the following graph.</p>

    <p>Overall, life impacts were more negative for females, democrats, and lower/ working
      class Utahns. Financial impacts were more positive for conservatives, but more negative
      for younger (18-34) and working/lower class Utahns. 5 Mental health was most negatively
      impacted for females and younger Utahns (18-34). Physical health was most likely to improve
      for males and older Utahns (65+).</p>

    <p>There’s a very distinguishable difference in political and scientific views within Utahns
      – some people assume they shouldn’t be concerned about climate change or wearing a mask
      (generally, these individuals follow the Republican Party, are upper class, very religious,
      or uneducated). Meanwhile, people concerned about wearing a mask or the very viewable effect
      of climate change tend to be Liberal, Democrat or highly educated. I will let readers set
      their own premises – conclusions for instance.</p>

  <section>
    <p>Face masks are the ubiquitous symbol of a pandemic that has sickened an utterly obnoxious
      amount of people, and killed more than 3.1 million persons. In hospitals and other
      health-care facilities, the use of medical-grade masks clearly cuts down transmission
      of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But for the variety of masks in use by the public,
      the data is messy, disparate and often hastily assembled, causing avoidable outcomes. </p>

    <p>Indeed, the discussion of whether we should or not wear a mask is still a thing... </p>

    <p>Almost 4.66 billion people were active internet, encompassing 59 percent of the
      global population. It would be ideal to ask ourselves how dangerous could be to claim
      something incorrect or misleading in the middle of a pandemic on the internet –
      things such as “The government is hiding microchips in Temple Square,” or “Be careful:
      the COVID-19 vaccines have a GPS to track us,” and of course: “5G produces cancer.”
      There are not enough words to describe the foolishness within those false premises,
      and we should probably not be looking for them. Not only that, but there was a
      divisive political discourse that included a US president disparaging the use of masks. </p>

    <p>Science supports using masks, with recent studies suggesting that they could save
      lives in different ways: research shows that they cut down the chances of both transmitting
      and catching the coronavirus, and some studies hint that masks might reduce the severity
      of infection if people do contract the disease. But being more definitive about how
      well they work or when to use them gets complicated. There are many types of mask,
      worn in a variety of environments. There are questions about people’s willingness
      to wear them, or wear them properly. Even the question of what kinds of study would
      provide definitive proof that they work is hard to answer.</p>

    <p>Perhaps, how good does the evidence need to be?</p>

    <p>Apparently it needs to be much better. For example, approximately 100 persons gathered
      at the front of the Idaho Capitol in the US to burn masks in a protest against measures
      taken to limit infections and deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Some groups
      said mask mandates are a "restriction of their freedoms." Videos posted on social media
      showed adults encouraging children to toss masks into a fire. In a series of such,
      people of all ages are seen walking up to a metal drum in which a fire is burning
      and throwing disposable masks inside. Protestors can be heard laughing and cheering
      after the masks are set alight.</p>

    <p>This is consequence of wrong/misleading data – such was and has been
      spreading through the internet, TV, etc.</p>

    <p>According to the 18 U.S.C. § 1038, "Whoever engages in any conduct with intent to convey
      false or misleading information under circumstances where such information may reasonably be
      believed and where such information indicates that an activity has taken, is taking, or will
      take place, then that would constitute a violation.” 3 These persons must be, therefore,
      fined under this title, or imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both. And of course,
      it can be much worse... But, why is nobody getting in trouble? How can the fact that we
      could potentially be harming someone due to his lack of knowledge be excused?
      In a nutshell, most fake-news sites often label their content as “satirical"
      to avoid any legal problems and persuade, however, as many persons as they can.</p>

    <p>Some persons agreed that misleading claims on social media will discourage COVID-19
      vaccination uptake, and others said that they would like to see greater transparency
      from social media platforms about the extent of misinformation so that public health
      authorities could effectively track and trace anti-vax sentiment. Certainly,
      social media has supercharged conspiracy theories and misinformation – there is
      a growing level of vaccine hesitancy and every study has shown up huge levels of
      misinformation around the world. In relation the previous idea, Liberals, Democrats,
      and Hispanics are less likely to trust information from Trump, while LDS residents
      of Utah are more likely to trust information from him. </p>

    <p>Trust in information from the state is higher among males, conservatives, Republicans,
      highly educated, older, upper class, and LDS Utah residents. The local government is
      trusted more often by conservative, upper class, suburban, and LDS residents.
      Scientists/researchers, the CDC, and WHO are more trusted as information sources among male,
      Liberal, Democrat, highly educated, upper/upper middle class and non-rural residents.</p>

    <p>Perhaps, some evidence suggests that donning a face mask might drive the wearer and those
      around them to adhere better to other measures, such as social distancing. The masks remind
      them of shared responsibility, but that requires that people wear them. Unfortunately,
      misinformation is being amplified on social media because tech giants design algorithms
      to offer content that keeps people engaged, as opposed to content that is factually correct. </p>

    <p>Sounds impossible, but we must redesign our information ecosystem. Such effort
      should be global in scope – more broadly, we must answer a fundamental question:
      How could we possibly create a news ecosystem and culture that values and promotes
      truth in not only Utah, but the United States? And once again, how good does the
      evidence need to be?</p>
